Description: Character sentences to numerical translation in Euros from spanish
    spelled monetary quantities. Text must be previously cleaned & removed 
    extraneous words, symbols or cents. Quantities MUST be written in a correct 
    Spanish cause this isn't a grammar tool. Upper limit is up to the millions 
    range. 
    Geocoding from cadastral reference number. Source data must be a valid 
    cadastral reference or downloaded kml files from catastro website.
    Be careful geocoding from catastro. You will be banned if many request
    are issued in a short period of time. geocode_cadastral() waits 2 seconds
    between requests.
